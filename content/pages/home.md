Home education is a personal choice. For us here in the Levesque household, we aim to promote and support the natural growth of each individual child while working cohesively in a family-style, roomless schoolhouse- evading doors, boundaries, and that nagging societal pressure of what education ought to look like.

If you would like to follow along, we'd love to have you become a part of our journey.
