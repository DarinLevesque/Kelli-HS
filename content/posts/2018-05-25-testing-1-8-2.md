  title: Homeschool Curriculum Favorites
---
Let’s be honest for a moment, 2020 has been a continuous blast of “seriously, can I just get a freakin’ break?!” As frustrating as this year has been, it is abundantly clear that you are not alone. Everyone on the planet is going through some drastic changes. If one of those changes happens to be the future education of your children, keep reading. Hopefully, we can help ease your mind, even if only a little bit.

Our family decided to homeschool three years ago when we realized that the public school education our son was getting just wasn’t working for him. The reason that you’re choosing to homeschool may be vastly different from ours. There are a variety of reasons (many more now given the current social situation)- some out of your control, but none-the-less, those reasons are important to assist you in making the best educational choices for your homeschool.

First and foremost, please check with local and state guidelines concerning laws for homeschooling. Though homeschooling is legal in all fifty states, each state has different rules to follow to be compliant. You can find an overview of those laws, by state, here.  https://homeschoolstatelaws.com/

Remember, what works for one family won’t necessarily work for another. Heck, what works for one of your children may not work for the next. Each family has its own set of priorities, expectations, commitments, and limitations. Be honest with yourself about what those are. For instance, if you like the idea of letting the kids embrace their inner artist and want them to run free to create whatever they dream up but in reality, you hate messes and glitter on the floor, that first option is probably not best suited for you.  

Think about how you want your homeschool to look. Do you want a set schedule with timestamps? Would you prefer a routine or would a checklist work better? Are you a stickler with certain things and much more passive with others? Is this newfound educational setup something you’re looking to stick with long term or just maintain until your child(ren) returns to public/private school?

Speaking of children- how many do you have? Are they all school-aged? Do you want them each to have individual lessons or is the idea of group learning more appealing to you? Are you aiming to teach most of the lessons yourself or would you prefer a more “open and go” approach? How do you feel about technology? How much or how little are you comfortable with?

Now, let’s talk about religion. The reason I bring this up is that a large percentage of homeschooling curriculum is faith-based. Do you want religious content or would you prefer secular or is faith-neutral okay? 

Okay, now that you’re ready to shut your computer down because this whole homeschooling journey seems so daunting - DON’T. These are important questions to ask yourself. If you don’t ask them now, they will come up later. I promise. Since you’ve made it this far, you’re already thinking about these options and pondering different scenarios, now is a great time to begin exploring curricula. There are endless options out there, but I’m here to give you a few of our family favorites along with others that though we may not have personal experience with, come highly regarded from trustworthy homeschoolers I know.

**FULL CURRICULUM**

These are usually an “open-and-go” type of program that comes with everything (or nearly everything) you will need to cover all subjects. Some include math while others leave that as a separate program to find elsewhere. 

[**_Blossom and Root (Family Favorite)_**
](https://blossomandroot.com/)

Nature-based, secular, and easy to follow. You will find that most of the recommended books you either have or can borrow from the library. I only bought 5 or 6 books for all of last year! It's also not a rigid, set-in-stone program. You can do some of it or all of it and still follow along. One of the best attributes is that it encourages play.

[**_The Good and the Beautiful_**](https://www.goodandbeautiful.com/)

[_**Brave Writer (Family Favorite)**_](https://bravewriter.com/)

A literature-based curriculum that can be used by the whole family. We get the Arrow subscription each year and all of our kids love reading the stories together. The older children dive a bit deeper into the grammatical aspects and the younger ones are eager to help out and participate whenever possible. This is a wonderful program to foster an early appreciation for reading and writing! Brave Write also offers online classes.

A mastery approach to mathematics, using manipulatives, songs, videos, and workbooks. Math-U-See is not organized traditionally by grades; the focus is on understanding math concepts. Math-U-See is designed to teach students specific skills that build as the student progresses. This systematic and cumulative approach uses a definite, logical sequence of concept instruction. The Math-U-See system is structured with step-by-step procedures for introducing, reviewing, practicing, and mastering concepts. Each lesson teaches using multi-sensory tools such as videos, manipulatives, and other resources, designed to appeal to any type of learner.

[_**Life of Fred**_](https://www.lifeoffred.uniquemath.com/)

Never again hear the question which many math students have: "When are we ever gonna use this stuff?" or "Math is boring!"

Each text is written in the style of a novel with a humorous storyline. Each section tells part of the life of Fred Gauss and how, in the course of his life, he encounters the need for the math and then learns the methods.

\*there are many places to find these fun math books, so search around if you find that a vendor is sold out

[

**SCIENCE**

[**_The Young Scientists Club_**](http://www.theyoungscientistsclub.com/)

The Young Scientists Club has award-winning science kits for kids. We used the Magic School Bus Science Kit last year and it was a hit with our kiddos. It is a subscription kit that comes once or twice per month (your choice). Each box covers a different science topic. They also offer a Clifford: The Big Red Dog subscription for younger children.

[**_Beautiful Feet_**](http://bfbooks.com/?tap_a=30494-e48ebf&tap_s=1035932-524c74)

Teaching history through the power of story is the best way to ignite a child’s natural curiosity about the world around them. This philosophy is why you won’t find textbooks, worksheets, and busywork with this program but rather history, geography, and social studies curricula are built upon excellent literature.

\*\*Beautiful Feet proudly offers a 10% discount to Missionaries, Active Duty Military, and Combat-Disabled Veterans.

[**_Story of the World_**](https://welltrainedmind.com/story-of-the-world/?v=7516fd43adaa)

[**Five Senses Literature**](https://www.5sensesll.com/)

Developed by an occupational therapist, these programs are adaptable and hands-on as they are intended to work with your child and their natural curiosities. My favorite thing about these programs is that they are designed by color levels and not by grade.

**FOREIGN LANGUAGE**

[**_Duolingo_**](https://www.duolingo.com/)

Available on the web or as an app, this free resource is a great way to learn a new language. Duolingo lessons adapt to your learning style. Exercises are tailored to help you learn and review vocabulary effectively. This new way of learning a language is fun (and dare I say addictive?) as you earn points for correct answers as you race the clock and level up.
