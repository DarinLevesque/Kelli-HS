## Background

We started home schooling roughly 3 years ago when we realized that traditional school was leaving our 7 year old behind and not attempting to catch him up. Since then we've been asked repeatedly what resources we utilize to make our homeschool "run." So we decided to create this site to showcase our journey into homeschool. Both the fun parts as well as the challenging parts.
